<h1>The Best Movies I Have Seen This Year</h1>
<h3>My top 3 movies of all time.</h3>
<hr />
<h4>Oppenheimer</h4>
<p>
    It is an intense drama. The acting is fantastic.<br />
    The visuals are realistically fantastic. The music<br />
    is intruguing.
</p>
<h4>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One</h4>
<p>
    The story is complex and interesting. The action scenes<br />
    are awesome. Seeing Tom Cruise run on big screen for <br />
    the first time was a blast. It is funny. Haley Atwell's <br />
    acting is praiseworthy. And much more.
</p>
<h4>Fall</h4>
<p>
    This movie is just intense. My palms were sweating while<br />
    watching this movie. There are lesson to be learnt from this<br />
    film.
